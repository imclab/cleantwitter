## Clean Twitter ##

This Safari 5 extension removes two features I find highly irritating from twitter.com:

1. The 'Trending Now' sidebar. I don't care what millions of Twitter users are discussing. It is now reset to "collapsed" when the page loads.
2. The 'Suggested Users' functionality. The heuristic which controls the display of these users is inevitably useless. It showed me a blocked user earlier today. The entire `<div>` is expunged upon page load, meaning it it simply never seen.

I hope these improvements make Twitter.com more bearable for you on those occasions when it must be visited.
